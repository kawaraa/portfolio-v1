              <h2>About me</h2>
              <p>I used to be an electronic engineer, but after 10 years of working in fixing smartphones I
                realized that I have big passion for Coding and Programing. so I looked for a school to study
                computer, and while I was in event for google on how to become a programmer, I met someone who
                suggested school to me called HackYourFuture. it's a coding school, this school changed my
                life path, I didn't just become a programmer I even changed the way I think. learning how to
                code never been easy, but the motivation and passion I have for programming, made me a code
                lover. yes I have always worked hard to gain as much experience as I can in this career. I
                love this aspect and I enjoy Working on both back-end as well as front-end development areas. I love
                building
                projects from start to finish for clients all over the world.</p>
              <p>I'm available for remote work, if you would like to build something together or you have any
                question, feel free to <a href="#contact" class="gen-links">get in touch</a>
