    <p class="about paragraph">I used to be an electronic engineer, but after 10 years of working in fixing smartphones
      I
      realised that I have big passion for Coding and Programming. so I looked for a school to study
      computer, and while I was in event for google on how to become a programmer, I met someone who
      suggested school to me called HackYourFuture. it's a coding school, this school changed my
      life path, I didn't just become a programmer I even changed the way I think. learning how to
      code never been easy, but the motivation and passion I have for programming, made me a code
      lover. yes I have always worked hard to gain as much experience as I can in this career. I
      love this aspect and I enjoy Working on both back-end as well as front-end development areas. I love
      building
      projects from start to finish for clients all over the world.</p>
    <p class="about paragraph">I'm available for remote work, if you would like to build something together or you have
